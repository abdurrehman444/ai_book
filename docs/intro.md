# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence in the Real World

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**, designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in AI, Robotics, and Computer Science. This textbook bridges the gap between digital AI and physical robotics, focusing on embodied intelligence that operates in the real world.

## About This Textbook

This 13-week course covers six core modules that will enable you to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots by integrating AI reasoning with sensors, actuators, and physical laws. You will learn to integrate ROS 2, simulation environments, and AI models into a single cohesive system.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Explain Physical AI and embodied intelligence principles clearly
- Build ROS 2-based robot control systems
- Simulate humanoid robots with realistic physics
- Develop AI perception and navigation pipelines
- Integrate language models into robotic action planning
- Understand sim-to-real deployment constraints

### Target Audiences

This textbook serves multiple audiences:
- **Students**: Advanced undergraduate and graduate students in AI, Robotics, and Computer Science
- **Educators**: Academic administrators evaluating Physical AI curricula
- **Hackathon Participants**: Builders working on embodied AI systems

## Hardware Requirements

This textbook assumes access to the following hardware stack:
- RTX enabled workstations for simulation and training
- Ubuntu Linux as the primary operating system
- Jetson Orin edge devices for inference
- Depth cameras, IMUs, and microphones for sensing

## Getting Started

Navigate through the modules sequentially or jump to specific topics of interest using the sidebar. Each module builds upon previous knowledge while remaining accessible for focused learning.

Begin with **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** to establish the foundational concepts of robotic software architecture.

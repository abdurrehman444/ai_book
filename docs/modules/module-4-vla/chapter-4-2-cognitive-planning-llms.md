# Chapter 4.2: Cognitive Planning with Large Language Models

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Use Large Language Models to translate natural language to ROS 2 action sequences
- Design multi-modal interaction systems combining speech, vision, and gesture
- Implement task planning pipelines that leverage LLM capabilities

## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities for natural language understanding and cognitive planning in robotics. This chapter covers how to leverage LLMs for translating natural language commands into executable robotic actions.

## LLM Integration with Robotics

LLMs can serve as high-level cognitive planners that interpret natural language and generate task sequences.

### LLM Architecture for Robotics

### Prompt Engineering for Robotic Tasks

### Safety and Reliability Considerations

## Natural Language to Action Sequences

Converting natural language commands to executable robotic actions requires careful planning and validation.

### Semantic Parsing

### Action Space Mapping

### Validation and Error Correction

## Multi-Modal Interaction Design

Effective human-robot interaction often combines multiple modalities including speech, vision, and gesture.

### Multi-Modal Fusion

### Context Awareness

### User Intent Recognition

## Task Planning Pipelines

LLMs can orchestrate complex task planning pipelines that coordinate multiple robotic capabilities.

### Hierarchical Task Planning

### Plan Execution and Monitoring

### Failure Recovery

## Practical Examples

This section provides practical examples of implementing LLM-based cognitive planning for robotics.

## Summary

This chapter covered the use of Large Language Models for cognitive planning in robotics, including natural language processing, multi-modal interaction, and task planning pipelines.

## Exercises

1. Implement an LLM-based natural language to action sequence translator
2. Design a multi-modal interaction system for your robot
3. Create a task planning pipeline using LLMs

## Assessment

Students should be able to implement a complete cognitive planning system that translates natural language commands into executable robotic actions.

# Chapter 5.1: Integrating Perception, Planning, and Control

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Integrate voice command processing with navigation and manipulation systems
- Combine perception, planning, and control in a unified humanoid robot system
- Design and implement obstacle detection and path replanning systems

## Introduction

This capstone chapter integrates the various subsystems developed throughout the textbook into a cohesive humanoid robot system. You'll learn how to coordinate perception, planning, and control for complex robotic tasks.

## System Integration Architecture

Integrating multiple robotic subsystems requires careful architectural design to ensure proper coordination and communication.

### Component Architecture

### Message Passing and Coordination

### State Management

## Perception Integration

The perception system combines multiple sensors to understand the environment and objects.

### Multi-Sensor Fusion

### Object Recognition and Tracking

### Environmental Mapping

## Planning and Decision Making

The planning system coordinates high-level goals with low-level execution.

### Hierarchical Planning

### Task Allocation

### Resource Management

## Control Systems Integration

The control system executes planned actions while maintaining system stability.

### Motion Control

### Manipulation Control

### Safety Systems

## Practical Examples

This section provides practical examples of integrating perception, planning, and control systems.

## Summary

This chapter demonstrated the integration of perception, planning, and control systems in a humanoid robot. You learned how to coordinate multiple subsystems for complex robotic tasks.

## Exercises

1. Integrate voice command processing with navigation and manipulation
2. Implement a complete perception-planning-control pipeline
3. Design a system that coordinates multiple robotic capabilities

## Assessment

Students should be able to implement a complete humanoid robot system that integrates perception, planning, and control for complex tasks.

# Appendix B: Assessment Guidelines

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this appendix, you should understand:
- The assessment criteria for each module in the textbook
- How to evaluate project deliverables for Physical AI applications
- The timeline and milestone tracking approach for the course

## Introduction

This appendix provides comprehensive assessment guidelines for educators, students, and evaluators. It outlines the criteria for successful completion of each module and provides frameworks for evaluating project deliverables.

## Assessment Framework

### Evaluation Criteria

The assessment follows these core principles:
- **Technical Proficiency**: Ability to implement the concepts correctly
- **Integration Skills**: Ability to connect different modules and subsystems
- **Problem-Solving**: Approach to handling challenges and debugging
- **Documentation**: Quality of code comments, reports, and presentations

### Assessment Methods

- **Practical Demonstrations**: Students demonstrate working implementations
- **Project Reports**: Written documentation of design decisions and results
- **Peer Reviews**: Collaborative evaluation of each other's work
- **Presentation**: Oral defense of technical implementations

## Module-Specific Assessments
